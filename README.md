# Media Doc
You can view the demo [here](https://sachinbiradar9.github.io/Media-Doc/)

Sometimes text is not the best way to document the code. New developer in the organization has to go through the entire the codebase to initially to get the bigger picture. He has to contact various developers if he does not understand some part of the code. It is time consuming for all the developers. It would be very convenient if developers keep an audio/video/image log of the code changes. They can also log the design meetings so that one can look back at it if required.

So, we hereby propose a solution to this problem which we call _Media Documentation_ which involves uploading audio/video/image with the commit to best explain the code. Developer trying to understand the code on Github can refer to this media doc.
